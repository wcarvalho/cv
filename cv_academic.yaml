research_interests:
  - My long-term goal is to develop theories for human learning and generalization. In particular, I'm interested in how we discover and exploit richly structured representations to enable sophisticated behavior and rapid adaptation. Currently, I'm interested in leveraging successor features to provide a unified framework for how brains learn, combine and transfer predictive knowledge and behavior.
