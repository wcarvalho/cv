# about: '
#   I am a fourth-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University
#   and am supported by an NSF graduate research fellowship.
#   I spent the first two years of my Ph.D. working on mobile systems
#   and now work with \href{http://zicokolter.com/}{Zico Kolter}
#   on machine learning and optimization.
#   I am particularly interested in improving our understanding of important
#   modeling problems in computer vision, language, and reinforcement learning
#   through the use of deep learning, optimization (sometimes convex),
#   theory, and statistics.
#   As examples, see our
#   \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07152}{input-convex neural network}
#   and
#   \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00443}{OptNet}
#   papers. \\[0.5em]

#   I strongly believe in open science and reproducible research
#   and actively publish code on \href{https://github.com/bamos}{my Github profile}.
#   I am also the author of
#   \href{https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/}{OpenFace},
#   which is an open source face recognition project that
#   uses deep learning.<br><br>'
